# Facial Recognition w/ Accessories using CNN
## Overview
This repository contains the [docker-compose.yml file](docker-compose.yml) that can be used after pulling the images from my [Docker hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/shafiqninaba/fyp). This project requires [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to run.

## Instructions
1. Download the [docker-compose.yml file](docker-compose.yml) into an empty folder.
2. Run the command `docker-compose up` in the same directory as the docker-compose.yml file.
3. After the containers are created, the web application can be accessed at http://localhost:5000/
